# Quality Assurance
*All Qualities, unlocked from the start! Quality Modules not included.*

Quality Assurance (Shorthand QA) is a mod which adds multiple things related to quality. This includes:

+ Base Quality - Adds quality to machines automatically, as if a quality module was added.
+ Early Quality Unlock - Enables all qualities to be unlocked at the quality module technology.
+ AMS Machines - Adds new machines which have additional module slots. These are slower than their normal counterparts, but the extra module slots are worth it.
+ Improving Quality Modules - Multiplies the quality effect of all quality modules, so you don't need to wait extremely long to get your high-quality items.
+ Quality Modules in Beacons - Allows you to place Quality Modules in beacons.
+ Everything is configurable - Most likely the best feature of the mod, all of the above features are fully configurable, or at least they should be.

If you encounter **any** issues, please turn on dev mode, load up the game and then send me a helpful message describing the issue as well as the factorio log file (can be uploaded in any way).
