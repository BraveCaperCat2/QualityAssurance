Version: 1.4.1
Date: 08/09/2025
  Changes:
    - Removed the settings to enable/disable AMS and Base Quality for crafting machines, as the crafting machine prototype type doesn't actually exist.
    - Removed hidden dependency on mod "alien-module", as it's no longer needed.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue where some modded machines would not recieve Base Quality or AMS versions.
      Some modded machines may still not recieve Base Quality or AMS versions if they are defined unusually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 19/08/2025
  Features:
    - Added back the setting to change the added module slots in AMS machines.
      You can even set the setting to a negative number to remove module slots where possible.
  Changes:
    - Almost finished working on 2 new (completely new, not just upgrades of original machines) quality-related machines.
      It only requires unhiding and unlocking the settings for them and implementing a fix for the crashes which will happen if you try to enable them yourself.
    - Unstopped working on the previously mentioned new machines, at least temporarily.
    - Replaced the code that decided how much faster or slower AMS machines are compared to their non-AMS conterparts depending on the number of module slots added.
  Bugfixes:
    - When using a negative number in the added module slots setting, AMS machine locales no longer show "with added module slots"* and similar text.
      *or the appropriate translation in your language.
