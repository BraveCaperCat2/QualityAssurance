[mod-setting-description]
qa_quality-unlock=The technology selected here will unlock every quality.
qa_early-quality-filter=Up to which qualitiy to be unlocked early. Use the internal names for qualities, for instance "uncommon", "rare", "epic", "legendary" for the qualities in the base game. Not case sensitive. An empty string or an invalid name will unlock all qualities. You can write comma separated list of qualities, but it will use the lates.

qa_quality-module-multiplier=The multiplier for the effect of quality modules. Only applies to modules which add positive quality.
qa_quality-beacons=If this is on, you can put quality modules in beacons.

qa_ams-machines-toggle=If this is on, you can make AMS machines. These are machines with additional module slots. Do not open a save game with these enabled with this off! It might break your save game!
qa_added-module-slots=The amount of additional module slots in AMS machines. Can be negative.\nWarning: Lowering this value may result in modules being deleted from existing AMS machines - reducing this value below 0 may delete AMS machines themselves in some cases. Setting this value to 0 will delete all AMS machines in existing save games. Be careful when changing this value in an existing save game!
qa_enable-ams-assembling-machine=Enables the creation of AMS versions of assembling machines.
qa_enable-ams-furnace=Enables the creation of AMS versions of furnaces.
qa_enable-ams-mining-drill=Enables the creation of AMS versions of mining drills.
qa_enable-ams-rocket-silo=Enables the creation of AMS versions of rocket silos.

qa_base-quality=If this is on, machines will have a base quality factor.
qa_base-quality-value=The value of base quality for machines as a precentage. Only applies if base quality is enabled.
qa_moduleless-quality=If this is on, the base quality setting will apply to machines without module slots.
qa_ams-base-quality-toggle=Removes effect of base quality from non-AMS machines, so they can be used as before. Allows separation of regular and quality setups in your game. To have any effect, you will require both base quality and AMS machines to be enabled.
qa_enable-base-quality-assembling-machine=Enables the addittion of base quality to assembling machines.
qa_enable-base-quality-furnace=Enables the addittion of base quality to furnaces.
qa_enable-base-quality-mining-drill=Enables the addittion of base quality to mining drills.
qa_enable-base-quality-rocket-silo=Enables the addittion of base quality to rocket silos.

qa_relabeler=Enables the Relabeler, which decreases the quality of items by ignoring the actual higher quality.
qa_upcycler=Enables the Upcycler, which has a chance to improve the quality of items, but also a chance of destroying them.

qa_dev-mode=If this is on, the mod will send lots of log messages in the log, otherwise it will not send any messages in the log. This is useful if you're trying to debug an error.
